# This is an example of a material for the engine's material system.
# It is a standard TOML file.
# It uses a hypothetical "Phong" material type, and adds the following custom features:
#  * World-space UV's for the usual textures
#  * Applies a faint see-through effect.
#  * A custom gradient for lighting (as a texture)
#  * A contrast effect to its final color based on another texture that uses mesh UV's

#TODO: Stencil settings.
#TODO: Alpha-test settings.
#TODO: Depth-test settings.
#TODO: MRT settings.
#TODO: Fog settings.
